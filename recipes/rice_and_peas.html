    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Rice and peas is a quintessential Jamaican side dish! It can pretty much be 
        served with all Jamaican dishes and it is one of the easiest foods to prepare.
        There are many ways to prepare it but the most common involves using red 
        kidney beans, coconut milk and common Jamaican seasonings which you will
        find below.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried red kidney beans, soaked in water for at least 8 hours</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>2 cups uncooked long grain rice</li>
        <li>13.5 ounce can full fat coconut milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3 stalks scallion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp pimento berries (allspice)</li>
        <li>A few sprigs of thyme</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse your soaked kidney beans thoroughly in a sieve, strainer or colander. Discard 
            that water it was soaking in.</li>
        <li>Cover with 3 cups water to cover the kidney beans.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then to a simmer at medium heat for 30 minutes to an hour (taste 
            test after 30 minutes to see if it's tender. You may need to add up to an extra cup 
            of water while the peas are simmering to ensure there's enough water in the pot.</li>
        <li>After your peas are cooked (don't wash the peas nor throw out the leftover water), 
            add in your rice, coconut milk, sea salt, scallion, scotch bonnet pepper, garlic, 
            pimento/allsprice, thyme. Stir to combine</li>
        <li>Cover your pot with a tight fitting lid. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer at 
            medium heat for about 15 minutes, then to low heat for about 5-10 more minutes until 
            the rice is fully cooked through. Rice may cook in a quicker time 
            period, or it may take a little bit longer. You may need to add in an extra 1/4 cup of 
            water in case the liquid boils out before the rice is fully cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let the rice sit, cover still on, for an extra 10 minutes. 
            Taste test and add anything if necessary. Remove the seasonings and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
