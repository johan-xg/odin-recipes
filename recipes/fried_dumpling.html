        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Fried dumplings are a favourite among Jamaicans when it comes to traditional breakfast foods.
            These golden balls of deliciousness are the perfect to eat by themselves or as a side to another 
            meal like ackee and saltfish, our national dish. The soft, fluffy interior covered by the crispy 
            exterior makes it irresistible and will definitely have you coming back for seconds. 
            I really hope you try this recipe!

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup all purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>2 tbsp granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp butter, room temperature</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium bowl. Add the granulated sugar and whisk it all together.</li>
            <li>Add the room temperature butter to the dry ingredients and use your hands to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li>Pour the water little by little and mix it all together, by using your hand to form a dough. Don't over work 
                the dough. It will be soft, but this is what will make the dumplings soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.</li>
            <li>Leave the dough in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Leave it covered for about an hour or let it stay 
                overnight (which is even better).</li>
            <li>Dust your surface with a small amount of flour and knead the dough. Divide into six pieces and use both hands 
                (the palm of your hand) by doing a circular motion to form each pieces into a ball. Set each ball aside</li>
            <li>Pour about 2 cups of oil in a deep medium pot. Allow the oil to be heated at about 300 F degrees.</li>
            <li>Add each ball to the heated oil and let them fry for about 8 to 10 minutes until golden brown. Rotating each ball as it fries to ensure even color.</li>
            <li>Put them on a paper towel to drain off any excess oil and cool. Enjoy them while they are warm!</li>
        </ol>
