        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        Brown Stew Chicken is a staple in Jamaican Cuisine. It's pretty easy to
        make and is guaranteed to be tasty and full of flavor! The dish is best
        served with Jamaican-style Rice & Peas. I hope you try it out!

        </ul>
        <h3>For the Rest</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced carrot</li>
            <li>1 cup quartered bell peppers</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix garlic white parts of green onions, brown sugar, thyme, habanero, 
                vinegar, ginger, salt, pepper, paprika, and allspice in a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Make 2 cuts, about 1-inch apart, into the skin side of each thigh, perpendicular 
                to the bone, cutting all the way down to the bone. Add chicken thighs to marinade; 
                mix until evenly coated. Cover and place in the refrigerator to marinate, at least 
                4 hours or up to 12 hours. If possible, flip thighs several times while marinating.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Scrape off any chunks of marinade from chicken into 
                the bowl and reserve for later.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large, deep, heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven over 
                medium-high heat until almost smoking. Working in batches, brown the chicken all 
                over, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to the marinade bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in the same pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and a 
                pinch of salt; cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon brown 
                sugar and cook until onions are dark brown and caramelized, 3 to 5 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Add chicken broth, ketchup, and bay leaves to the pan; bring to a boil. Add carrots, 
                bell peppers, browned chicken thighs, and reserved marinade.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until chicken is tender 
                and no longer pink in the center and sauce has reduced and thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 
                hours. Skim excess fat that floats to the top; baste chicken occasionally with sauce.</li>
            <li>Taste and adjust seasoning. Stir in green parts of green onions.</li>
        </ol>
